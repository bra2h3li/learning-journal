How Computers Work:
The computer does its primary work in a part of the machine we cannot see, a control
center that converts data input to information output. This control center, called the central 
processing unit (CPU), is a highly complex, extensive set of electronic circuitry that
executes stored program instructions.

All computers, large and small, must have a central
processing unit. As Figure 1 shows, the central processing unit 
consists of two parts: The control unit and the arithmetic/logic unit. Each part has a specific function.


The Control Unit
The control unit of the CPU contains circuitry that uses
electrical signals to direct the entire computer system to carry out, or execute, stored program
instructions. Like an orchestra leader, the control unit does not execute
program instructions; rather, it directs other parts of
the system to do so. The control unit must communicate with both the 
arithmetic/logic unit and memory.

The Arithmetic/Logic Unit
The arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) contains the electronic circuitry that executes
all arithmetic and logical operations.

A computer can simultaneously test for more than one condition. In fact, a logic uni
t can usually discern six logical relationships: equal to, less than,
greater than, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to, and not equal.

The symbols that let you define the type of comparison
you want the computer to perform are called relational operators. The most common 
relational operators are the equal sign(=), the less-than symbol(<), 
and the greater-than symbol(>).
