JavaScript Display Possibilities
JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
Writing into the browser console, using console.log().





JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.

In this example, x, y, and z, are variables:

Example
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;


javaScript Data Types
JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".

In programming, text values are called text strings.

JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.

Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.

If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.

Example
var pi = 3.14;
var person = "John Doe";
var answer = 'Yes I am!';

JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.

JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.

Single Line Comments
Single line comments start with //.

Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript
